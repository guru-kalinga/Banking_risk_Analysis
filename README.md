# Banking Risk Analytics: Identifying Loan Default Patterns

## 📄 Overview
This project analyzes banking customer data to identify high-risk segments that are more likely to default on loans. The goal is to help banks minimize risk and make data-driven lending decisions.

## 📊 Dataset
A sample banking dataset provided as part of a learning project.
The data is in Excel format and includes customer demographics, banking relationships, income, savings, and credit details. 

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Power BI (Dashboard)
- MySQL (Data querying)

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Insights & Risk Pattern Detection  
4. SQL Queries for Deep Analysis  
5. Dashboard Creation in Power BI  

## 📌 Key Insights
- Mid-income, European-nationality clients form the largest customer segment and contribute most to loan and deposit volumes.
